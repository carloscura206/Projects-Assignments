### 1. Introduction

In this project, we are going to dive into a person's mental wellness specifically in the tech industry. The tech environment is stressful as its importance is of high productivity from the workers in this field. Within this domain, we will focus on people's cognitive minds where we analyze the output of their mental health & mental disorders they attained. In our study we will be showcasing several research questions that help analyze mental status. These questions are in-depth as it focuses on a combination between a person's health and the tech industry and more specifically with how an individual’s intersectional identity might interact with their mental wellness in the industry. At a broader level, we wonder, “How seriously is mental health taken in the tech industry?” Before we can dive into specific issues within the community and at an individual basis, we must gauge where we stand in terms of an ability and willingness to recognize mental health in these spaces. In addition to this, “Does working remotely within the tech industry negatively impact mental health?” Over the past couple of years, we have all had a taste of what working remotely is like and it is an important question to consider as many jobs within the tech industry are remote and potentially isolating. Lastly, “Does gender/race/gender identity impact mental health and wellness in the tech industry?” Knowing that many spaces within the industry tend to house the similar people in terms of gender, race, and gender identity, we wonder how a disruption in that would take a toll on the folks involved in diversifying the field. Overall, These questions are important because they help us begin to better understand the relationship between mental health issues and working in the tech industry. Using these questions, we can move forward and begin to think of solutions to combat these issues.

### 2. Related Work  

Our topic delves deep on a person's mental health in the tech industry. Though we believe that there is a correlation between people's wellness in the tech industry, we haven’t found a concise solution to apply. One of these articles offers a solution, being that workers can come together with their supervisors and bring up the matter of any possible mental disorders they have attained from the company (Thompson, 2022). This allows people to be more open and take a matter of engagement within the establishment which can lead to supporting them in their mental status and  understanding where a worker is in their wellbeing.

Mental health in the tech industry as well as the relationship between individuals’ identities in the field and how that impacts their job satisfaction has been a topic of concern for a while now. As with many other jobs, gender, ethnicity, (dis)ability, sexual orientation, and many more core aspects of our intersectional identities impact the experiences of individuals in the tech industry who might not fit into the patriarchal societal norms just as much, if not more. In an industry historically built on educated, white, male-dominated spaces, women and minorities in tech have a much more difficult time facing discrimination, stress problems, and more which lead to lower job satisfaction and heightened anxiety and depression (Heubl, 2019).

Overall, diversity plays a key role with mental health, especially in the tech industry. It is incredibly needed to recognize how diversity impacts individuals' mental health in the workplace. creating a space of inclusion can protect an employees mental health while simultaneously supporting diversity goals. It is said that poor mental health is directly linked to one’s physical health, meaning it is necessary to make an employees’ mental health a priority (Workplace Diversity…, 2019). Making an inclusion of mental health awareness in the tech industry brings many benefits, such as loyalty, support, better job satisfaction, and better wellness overall, which promotes a healthy work life balance and betters the ability to bring innovations to clients. Mental health is such an important aspect of one’s overall well-being and that is why we must take initiative to create a space of acceptance, inclusion, and acknowledgement with a collective effort to address the changes that need to be made within the industry.

### 3. The Dataset

The [data](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fanth7310%2Fmental-health-in-the-tech-industry&h=AT2a-DoxWa4fBx3ns19YdQRUnI2JAp-vmeSFlcg5NO3KeVmV63ro46zASs5BRXD77RjG6T_l2KWv-eUYl-7M_hTlDKUg_OWJj04KYqNc7dvVifefO8rtVASKnhuh54sMAHMMaw)* was found and provided by Data.gov. It was collected by Anthony Inthavong, Saman Siadati, and Subhroonel Moitra. Data.gov gathers its information from survey data within an open source that serves mental health data, to inform the frequency of mental health in the tech industry and bring forth awareness. There are 4220 observations and 120 features in our data. Ethical questions of power that arise when considering this data are different ethnic groups and how much each group has similarities and/or differences in results of stress. Possible limitations with the data are the amount of data provided and if the scaling of it, is matched. Meaning, that because there is an abundance of data provided with Data.gov, it can be challenging for data collectors to gather data while providing accurate outcomes. This creates an atmosphere of the complex issue of supplying data while simultaneously an increase of information, if not handled properly. Although having a great deal of data is beneficial, it may result in poor-quality data. This is incredibly harmful since it makes all the data provided unreliable and of no use, having it be one possible limitation to this data that needs to be looked out for and addressed.

*The original data is split into two separate datasets. With permission from our TA, we have combined the data and converted it into a .csv file for usability purposes. It is pushed to our GitHub repository for reference.

### 4. Implications

We raise the assumption that mental wellness in the tech industry is considerably low considering that it is a face paced company that values quickness & efficiency. It can be attributed that with more awareness made upon the mental health in this industry, we can raise awareness of it to engage in policy makers decisions to look at peoples health more carefully which can lead to solutions. With more awareness, we can look at specific illnesses that people have which can lead to solutions that can be implemented into the future. We can also see the plausible causes that are targeting people's well-being. Doing all this can lead to  better work habits & a comfortable environment for technologists, the workers that are the constructors of this industry .Lastly, it will be safer for not just the person itself but for the companies benefit as better quality workers can boost work productivity and overall business performance.

### 5. Limitations & Challenges
Possible limitations with this data could be how to prompt systemic change within the tech industry, in regards to mental health. The data allows one to take into consideration how mental health plays into the tech field but doesn’t provide much of a solution on how to address it. The data is supplied, yet still would be incredibly difficult to fully address its underlying issues with mental health, in an appropriate timely manner. Regardless of how much data is put out, it brings forth the notion that a solution needs to be provided. Which is exactly what we propose to do with our project idea, by inciting a possible systematic change to combat mental health in the tech industry, but will be difficult to handle. Since mental health is an enormous issue to tackle, we plan to address the urgency of it for it to be handled promptly. Also, since there is a ton of data provided, it could possibly not be an accurate representation of the actual industry. There is a generous amount of data given, which is incredibly beneficial in different ways, yet can make it difficult to differentiate between what is a precise or justified depiction of the tech industry itself. Finally, it is important to know how people of color handle stress in the tech field, but unfortunately, there seems to be leverage given to white people in the specific field making it more difficult for people of color to flourish, which might present itself through our data. This furthermore promotes inequality for minorities that needs to be addressed.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
# Conclusion - So What?

In analyzing this dataset, our suspicions about the stigma surrounding mental health in the tech industry were confirmed. As shown through our interactive charts, the tech industry does not place enough emphasis on prioritizing workers' mental wellbeing. Whether this is being done on purpose or not, the negative impact is still being reflected in the driving force behind the industry.

In the first interactive page, we provided a range of relevant questions from the
dataset for the user(s) to choose from as well as the year to which those
responses correspond. It provided a broad view into the perspectives and
experiences of all tech workers that responded to the survey, regardless of
country, age, gender, race, and more. This chart showed us the general consensus
surrounding mental health stigma and recognition within the industry and
exposed the need for more to be done in favor of mental health awareness.

In the second interactive page, we focused on the evaluation where workers would specify if  they had a mental disorder while working in the industry. From this visualization, we can take away that throughout the years there were more “Yes'' answers than “No”’s in both the male and female results, thus deducting that employees had sufferings in their wellness that created a degree of mental illness. We also divided our findings in a gender perspective and found that there are more men who have mental disorders than women overtime, which discloses that men have a harder time in mental thoughtness that raises the bigger issue of
the environment & the higher authority being unsupportive/unknowing of one's well being.

In the third interactive page, we took a look at a more zoomed in approximation
of the tangible impacts of mental health on workers in the tech industry. By
viewing the percentage of work from each respondent that is affected by mental
health issues, we were able to gauge and even deeper understanding of the scope
and measurable proportion of the impact that a lack of mental health recognition
and acknowledgement has.

Considering the priorities of various tech companies and employers- whether it
is attempting to diversify the industry by attracting marginalized and/or
underrepresented folks or to churn out the maximum output and monetary gain that
they possibly can from their employees- the conclusions that can be drawn from
our charts is shocking. If productivity is negatively impacted, folks with
certain identities are disproportionately conflicted, and tech industry workers
in general recognize their lack of protection on the basis of mental wellness,
why shouldn't the industry focus more efforts into mental health awareness? Moving
forward, companies must open up a more straight-forward dialogue between coworkers
and employers and begin recognizing mental health and wellness as an important
aspect part of their success.
