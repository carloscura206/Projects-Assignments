# Conclusion - So What?
   
In analyzing this dataset, our suspicions about the stigma surrounding mental health in the tech industry were confirmed. As shown through our interactive charts, the tech industry does not place enough emphasis on prioritizing workers' mental wellbeing. Whether this is being done on purpose or not, the negative impact is still being reflected in the driving force behind the industry.

In the first interactive page, we provided a range of relevant questions from the
dataset for the user(s) to choose from as well as the year to which those 
responses correspond. It provided a broad view into the perspectives and
experiences of all tech workers that responded to the survey, regardless of 
country, age, gender, race, and more. This chart showed us the general consensus
surrounding mental health stigma and recognition within the industry and
exposed the need for more to be done in favor of mental health awareness.

In the second interactive page, we focused on the evaluation where workers would specify if  they had a mental disorder while working in the industry. From this visualization, we can take away that throughout the years there were more "Yes'' answers than "No"'s in both the male and female results, thus deducting that employees had sufferings in their wellness that created a degree of mental illness. We also divided our findings in a gender perspective and found that there are more men who have mental disorders than women overtime, which discloses that men have a harder time in mental thoughtness that raises the bigger issue of 
the environment & the higher authority being unsupportive/unknowing of one's well being.

In the third interactive page, we took a look at a more zoomed in approximation
of the tangible impacts of mental health on workers in the tech industry. By 
viewing the percentage of work from each respondent that is affected by mental
health issues, we were able to gauge and even deeper understanding of the scope
and measurable proportion of the impact that a lack of mental health recognition
and acknowledgement has.

Considering the priorities of various tech companies and employers- whether it
is attempting to diversify the industry by attracting marginalized and/or
underrepresented folks or to churn out the maximum output and monetary gain that 
they possibly can from their employees- the conclusions that can be drawn from
our charts is shocking. If productivity is negatively impacted, folks with
certain identities are disproportionately conflicted, and tech industry workers
in general recognize their lack of protection on the basis of mental wellness, 
why shouldn't the industry focus more efforts into mental health awareness? Moving
forward, companies must open up a more straight-forward dialogue between coworkers
and employers and begin recognizing mental health and wellness as an important
aspect part of their success.

All in all, with our analysis we gained much insight but most importantly how mental health plays an enormous role in the tech industry. Itâ€™s important to note how work time can go unnoticed but plays into one's mental health. Which is why tech companies should promote health and a great wellbeing. Implementing this in the work setting, does many benefits and allows staff to feel understood. Which in turn, brings forth great welfare to the tech industry because it moves away from a hostile environment to a pleasant nature that promotes communication.
